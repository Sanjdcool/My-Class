## Introduction

This app was built as my final project during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. This full stack app was made entirely by me using a Django/PostgreSQL/Python backend database, with a frontend in React.js. This application is a place for teachers to upload and share their lessons with students and gain inspiration from other teachers. It is vibrant and fun and completely mobile responsive to ensure students with limited technology can access the pages.

## Planning Process

## Backend and Database

## Wireframes and Frontend

I really wanted to ensure this app was visually striking in order to engage and excite the user, so I knew I wanted to give a good amount of time to how my frontend application looked. In order to do this, I used Figma to plan out the feel of the design of my site, as well as considering how the user journey would work and how each CRUD operation would be accessed by the front end interface.

### Homepage

As the content on this site is generated entirely by users, the homepage needed to show users that they would need to login or register to access the CRUD operations. There are read-only elements of the site, but I wanted the messaging to be to login as a teacher user!

### Register and Login forms

These forms create post requests to the User database, and ensure the user provides the information required as a Django basic user, but also for the additional features needed to create a user profile/class, like profile picture and display name (which shows as the name for their classroom).
