Create a diamond by joining these vanishing points with the top and bottom of the vertical line. Decide where you want your walls to end and draw a vertical line each side. connect the top and bottom of each wall with the vanishing point on the opposite side of the page. Now yo uhave an empty 3D room!",

    "summary": "In this lesson you have used simple lines on paper to create an interior looks 3D! What other places could you draw in this way? Could you draw the exterior of a building using a similar technique? What would you have to change?",
